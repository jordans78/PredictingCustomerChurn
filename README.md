# Predicting Customer Churn

# Introduction
Competitive customer-dependent organizations, such as those in the banking industry,
are some of the most affected sectors by the free market economy, which allow service
providers to compete against one another for the attention of customers. Given that
customers are the most valuable assets that have a direct impact on the revenue of the
banking industry, customer churn is a source of major concern for service organizations

## What is Customer Churn?
Churn describes a state where a customer
unsubscribes or leaves an organization for its competitor, thereby leading to a loss in revenue
and profit. It is calculated by the number of customers who leave your company during a given time period, meaning
churn rate shows how your business is doing with keeping customers by your side.

## Why does churn matter?
The financial aspect of churn that causes most trouble.
The cost of acquring a customer is higher than the cost of retination and that is the reason why a bank would try to keep their old customers
And it costs even more to bring a new customer up to the same level as an existing customer
Given the importance of customers and the higher costs of attracting new customers
compared with retaining existing ones, banks and other customer-dependent industries
must be able to automate the process of predicting the behaviors of their customers using
customersâ€™ data in their database.
The advancement of technology in the last few decades has made it possible for
banks and many other service organizations to collect and store data about their customers
and classify them into either the churner or non-churner categories. Data by themselves do
not have much value if they are not studied to reveal the information contained in them.
Our model will forecast customer churn based on patterns that were noted in the past, by analyzing features such as personal details, earnings and spending habits.

# EDA

Our model will forecast customer churn based on patterns that were noted in the past 12 months, by analyzing features such as client's personal details, earnings and spending habits.

## The DATA

The dataset constains 10127 clients with 21 features of which 6 are categorical and 15 are numerical. from the given set we aim to build a supervised learning algorithm to perform a classification task

| Attrition\_Flag:            | Our target value - whenter our client has attrited or not attrited.

An imbalanced classification problem is an example of a classification problem where the distribution of examples across the known classes is biased or skewed. The distribution can vary from a  slight bias to a severe imbalance where there is one example in the minority class for hundreds, thousands, or millions of examples in the majority class or classes. | ![photo](https://github.com/jordans78/PredictingCustomerChurn/blob/main/Documentation/Python/ScikitlearnEnviroment/arritation%20flag.png?raw=true)|

# Handling missing values

Handling missing values is an essential part of data cleaning and preparation process because almost all data in real life comes with some missing values.
Our dataset does not have any nulls or blanks. However, there are a few unussual values in the Months_on_book column which can be noticed from the histogram  and the boxplot, 
since there are only 52 cases of unusual value, we decedied that removing these rows will not do any harm to the dataset in this case so we filtered out this column's values between 0 and 500 months.

# Classification models

## 1. Scikit-learn environment

In our manual approach in Scikit-learn environment, we used seven main supervised learning algorithms:  Dummy classifier (DC), Naive bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic regression(LR) and Random Forest (RF).


**Dummy classifier (DC)**.We started with a DC like baseline classifier.This kind of model often is used like a benchmark or in other words if this model gives us better results than other models we donâ€™t need to use other sophisticated models and vice versa. For the purpose of this modeling we used  stratified  DC which generates random predictions by respecting the training set class distribution.Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.7176, Precision  0.8380, Recall 0.8226, F1 Score 0.8303 and FBeta Score 0.8378.Ð¢hese metrics will take as a benchmark and expect the following models give us much better results.

**Naive bayes (NB)**. In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naÃ¯ve) independence assumptions between the features. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.894293, Precision  0.937315, Recall 0.936761, F1 Score 0.937038 and FBeta Score 0.937310.Ð¢hese metrics are better than metrics from DC, so now we have solid base to continue to examine further with other models.

**Decision Tree (DT)**. Decision tree learning or induction of decision trees is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.913151, Precision  0.937315, Recall 0.973995, F1 Score 0.949582 and FBeta Score 0.926812.Ð¢hese metrics are better than metrics from DC and also NB. In order to make better results with this model we applied fine tuning with this algorithm. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.941935, Precision  0.960257, Recall 0.971040, F1 Score 0.965619 and FBeta Score 0.960363.So here we can conclude that DT with tuning  parameters fitting better than DT  model with default parameters.


**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric classification method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for classification and regression.In this case we used KNN for classification problem.Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.895782 , Precision  0.927336, Recall 0.950355, F1 Score 0.938704 and FBeta Score 0.927558.In order to make better results with this model we applied fine tuning with this algorithm. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.887841, Precision 0.909497, Recall 0.962175 , F1 Score 0.935095 and FBeta Score 0.909990. So here we can conclude that KNN with default parameters fitting better than KNN model with tuning parameters.

**eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**. Gradient Boosting Machines are one of the most popular boosting machines and were originally devised by Jerome Friedman. Gradient Boosting Machines are considered a â€˜gradient busterâ€™ as the algorithm iteratively solves residuals and the boosted characteristics are derived from the use of multiple weak models algorithmically (Gutierrez, 2015, p. 247). Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.976179 , Precision  0.981829 , Recall 0.989953 , F1 Score 0.985874 and FBeta Score 0.981909. In order to make better results with this model we applied fine tuning with this algorithm. Results with this model we applied fine tuning with this algorithm but results are the same as with default parameters.

**Logistic regression (LR)**. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression(or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression). Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.976179 , Precision 0.920697 , Recall 0.967494 , F1 Score 0.943516 and FBeta Score 0.921139.

**Random forests (RF)**. These ensemble methods usually combine the classification and prediction results of many different models. The individual models are known as â€˜weak learnersâ€™ because individually they have poor predictive performance. Random forests are an ensemble classifier that fits a large number of decision trees to a data set, and then combines the predictions from all the trees and for regression, forests are created by averaging over trees.Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.882878, Precision 0.881952, Recall 0.993499 , F1 Score 0.934408 and FBeta Score 0.882933. In order to make better results with this model we applied fine tuning with this algorithm. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.961787 , Precision 0.967574 , Recall 0.987589 , F1 Score 0.977479   and FBeta Score 0.967768.So here we can conclude that RF with tuned parameters can fit much better than with default.

A total of seven supervised models were assessed. The best performing model is XGBoost which predicted customs churn with 97,61% accuracy.

**The ROC curve**.

In order to evaluate the classifiaction models we used the Receiver Operationg Characteristic, which is a very usful tool when predicting the probability of a binary outcome. THE ROC curve is probbility curve that plots the True positive rate agains the false positive rate. The true positive rate is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false negatives and it describes how good the model is at predicting the positive class when the actual outcome is positive. The false positive rate is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the sum of the number of false positives and the number of true negatives and it summarizes how often a positive class is predicted when the actual outcome is negative. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve. The higher the AUC the he better the performance of the model. When 0.5<AUC<1, there is a high chance that the classifier will be able to distinguish the positive class values from the negative class values.

In our case, beside the Dummy classifier, all the models showed a AUC above 0.5. The top 3 models based on this metric are: XGBClassifier (AUC=0.99), Random Forest Classifier (AUC=0.94) and GridSearchCV(AUC=0.92). Acorrding to this findigs the best model is XGBClassifier. The classifier is able to perfectly distinguish between all the Positive and the Negative class points correctly.

# 3. R environment

In our approach to machine learning in R environment, we used seven different supervised learning algorithms:  C5.0 algorithm (C5.0 ),Stochastic Gradient Boosting(GBM),Random Forest(RF),K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and regression trees (CART), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic regression (LR).The algorithms were chosen for their diversity of representation and learning style.The main evaluation metric is Accuracy and Kappa because they are easy to interpret. In order to get more robust results with this approach we also used repeated cross validation with 10 folds and 3 repeats, which is a common standard configuration for comparing models.  They include:

**C5.0.** While there are numerous implementations of decision trees, one of the most well-known is the C5.0 algorithm. This algorithm is an evolution of the C4.5 of Quinlan (1993). The C5.0 algorithm has become the industry standard for producing decision trees, because it does well on foremost types of problems directly out of the box.Compared to more advanced and sophisticated machine learning models the decision trees under the C5.0 algorithm generally perform nearly as well but are much easier to understand and deploy. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.999, Kappa 0.9963, Sensitivity 0.9988, Specificity 1.0000, Pos Pred Value : 1.0000 , Pos Pred Value 1.0000 and Neg Pred Value 0.9938. With repeated cross validation mean values of output metrics are: Accuracy 0.9707856 and Kappa 0.8902905. So in the end we can conclude that  results are a little bit lower in comparison without validation which is logical to expect.

**Stochastic Gradient Boosting(GBM)**. In the previous section we already explain this model so here we will focus only on output metrics. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.9692 , Kappa 0.8806, Sensitivity 0.9911, Specificity 0.8540, Pos Pred Value : 0.9727,Pos Pred Value : 0.9727 and Neg Pred Value : 0.9483 
With repeated cross validation mean values of output metrics are: Accuracy 0.9654257 and Kappa 0.8661343.

**Random Forest(RF)**. In the previous section we already explain this model so here we will focus only on output metrics and similar like GBM here we will only focus on results. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 1.000 , Kappa 1.000, Sensitivity 1.000, Specificity 1.000, Pos Pred Value : 1.000, and Neg Pred Value : 1.000 
With repeated cross validation mean values of output metrics are: Accuracy 0.9626463 and Kappa 0.8580475.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. Similar like GBM and RF here we will only focus on results.Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.8828 , Kappa 0.425, Sensitivity 0.9870, Specificity 0.3354, Pos Pred Value : 0.8864, and Neg Pred Value : 0.8308. With repeated cross validation mean values of output metrics are: Accuracy 0.8604791 and Kappa 0.2621685.In order to make better results with this model we applied fine tuning with this algorithm. Output metrics with tunned parameters are: Accuracy 0.8613675 and Kappa 0.2928376.

**Classification and regression trees (CART).** Originally CART was proposed by Breiman et al. (1984). This form of algorithm is a decision tree and is designed for numerical, continuous predictors and categorical response variables. However, decisions trees are highly prone to overfitting and we must be aware of this weakness. Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.9057 , Kappa 0.6212, Sensitivity 0.9610, Specificity 0.9610, Pos Pred Value : 0.9291 and Neg Pred Value 0.7500. With repeated cross validation mean values of output metrics are: Accuracy 0.9048474  and Kappa 0.6242659. 



**Support Vector Machine (SVM).** These algorithms are linear classifiers that find a hyperplane that best separates two classes of data, a positive class and a negative class.Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Vapnik et al., 1997), SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Output metrics from this model are: Accuracy 0.9345 , Kappa 0.7295, Sensitivity 0.9840, Specificity 0.6739 , Pos Pred Value : 0.9407 and Neg Pred Value 0.8893. 
With repeated cross validation mean values of output metrics are: Accuracy 0.9048474  and Kappa 0.6242659. In order to make better results with this model we applied fine tuning with this algorithm. Output metrics with tunned parameters are: Accuracy 0.9291532 and Kappa 0.7179899.

**Logistic regression (LR)**. Similar like GBM,RF and KNN here we will only focus on results. Output metrics from this model are: AAccuracy 0.9067 , Kappa 0.6231 , Sensitivity 0.9628 , Specificity 0.6118 , Pos Pred Value : 0.9287 and Neg Pred Value 0.7577. With repeated cross validation mean values of output metrics are: Accuracy 0.9046157 and Kappa 0.6082591.
